# TripAdvisor Crawling Suite


### DISCLAIMER
THIS SOURCE CODE IS PROVIDED FOR GENERAL PYTHON PROGRAMMING LEARNING ONLY. YOUR USE OF ANY OF THE SOURCE CODE IS AT YOUR OWN RISK.


### Update: June 2020
The current suite is no longer working as TripAdvisor has changed its website layout. However, most of the code used is still applicable to the crawling procedure of TripAdvisor. If you are interested in using this suite, please feel free to make necessary changes to the code. In another [repository](https://github.com/tokawah/Location-based-Social-Networks), a viable solution is provided to collect restaurant information from TripAdvisor.
